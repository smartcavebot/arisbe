## 0. What Arisbe is, in three sentences

Arisbe gives you an environment for **doing logic in pictures, not pictures of
logic** — Charles Sanders Peirce's "moving pictures of thought" made operational.
You draw, transform, and contest **Existential Graphs** ([EGs](GLOSSARY.md#eg)) directly; the picture *is* the
reasoning, not an illustration of reasoning done elsewhere. Peirce sets the **aim**;
Frithjof Dau's formalization serves as the **guarantor of correctness** underneath.

If you read nothing else first, read the one-page
[FIELD_GUIDE_AND_DRAGONS.md](FIELD_GUIDE_AND_DRAGONS.md). You need only **four
marks** (a sheet, a cut, nested cuts, a line), and you can draw all of logic that
matters here with a pen.

---

## 1. The shared five minutes (everyone starts here)

**You do not need any logic or mathematics to begin.** You need a terminal and a
browser. The runtime prerequisites are **Python 3.12+**, **uv**, and **Node.js with
npm** (CI uses Node 22). Node is required by the production ELK graph-layout worker;
it is not an optional development tool.

### Run it

From the repository root, run the canonical bootstrap:

```bash
python tools/bootstrap.py
uv run uvicorn --app-dir src web_api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The bootstrap replays both committed dependency graphs (`uv.lock` and
`package-lock.json`) and then runs a deployment verifier that exercises the real
Python → Node → ELK layout path. If setup is interrupted or a local dependency is
removed, rerun the same command; to diagnose without installing anything, run
`uv run python tools/verify_deployment.py`.

For the full browser-level deployment proof, including a real Chromium render and
screenshot, run `python tools/bootstrap.py --with-browser`. The canonical CI uses
the same bootstrap contract. See [DEPLOYMENT_HARDENING.md](DEPLOYMENT_HARDENING.md)
for the failure that motivated this gate and the reproduction methodology.

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> and click **"New here?"**. The in-app **primer**
draws a handful of first graphs with the real engine (a scroll, an empty cut) and
deep-links you into practice.

### The three modes, in one breath

Arisbe surfaces three *conceptual modes* (after their Greek names) as routes in the
web app:

| Mode | Greek | What you do there | Open |
|------|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Organon** | "instrument" | Browse the corpus, read worked proofs, step a chain — **read-only** | `/organon` |
| **Ergasterion** | "workshop" | Draw a graph freehand, have Arisbe *read it back*, practise the rules, take a **challenge** | `/ergasterion` |
| **Agon** | "contest" | Play a proposition against a world (a model **M**): get a verdict + witness, or ask "where does this hold?" | `/agon` |

### Your first graph, two ways

- **Read one.** Open `/organon`, pick `peirce_cp_4_394_man_mortal`, and watch
  "every man is mortal" drawn as a *[scroll](GLOSSARY.md#scroll)* (nested cuts). Toggle its linear forms
  (Existential Graph Interchange Format ([EGIF](GLOSSARY.md#egif)) / Conceptual Graph Interchange Format ([CGIF](GLOSSARY.md#cgif)) / Common Logic Interchange Format ([CLIF](GLOSSARY.md#clif)) / First-Order Predicate Logic ([FOPL](GLOSSARY.md#fopl))) and watch the same proposition stay recognizable.
- **Draw one.** Open `/ergasterion`, switch to **challenge mode**, pick the dragon
  `🐉1` "every man is mortal," and draw it freehand. Arisbe grades your attempt with
  a **plain-language diff** of how it differs — and hands back the antidote when you
  trip. (The five drawable [dragons](FIELD_GUIDE_AND_DRAGONS.md) are each a
  challenge.)

### The one discipline to internalize early

Arisbe **attests correspondence, never truth.** It guarantees your *picture and
your sentence say the same thing*; it never claims either is *true of the world*.
You earn truth elsewhere — by surviving challenge, in the Agon — and you can lose
it again. Hold that and you will not misread anything below. (The deep account
lives in [MANIFEST_AND_MEANING.md](MANIFEST_AND_MEANING.md).)

---

## 2. Pick your door

Now branch. Each door below tells you **what you already care about**, **the
shortest path in**, **what to read**, and **the honest frontier** for your kind of
work. The doors overlap on purpose. Read more than one.

---

### 2a. The newcomer — "I've never done formal logic"

**Start here and stay a while.** You don't need symbols; you need the four marks and
a feel for the handful of places the picture fools people.

1. [FIELD_GUIDE_AND_DRAGONS.md](FIELD_GUIDE_AND_DRAGONS.md) teaches the visual
   alphabet, then the eight **dragons** — "here be dragons" spots where the rules
   forbid a natural-seeming move, or where the picture means the opposite of what
   it looks like. You can type every example into the viewer.
2. In the app, start with the **primer** ("New here?"), then **challenge mode** in
   Ergasterion. Draw the dragons; let the grader teach you by correcting your hand.
3. When you want the *ideas* behind it — what counts as a fact, why a name buys
   nothing — read [FIDELITY_A_PLAIN_ACCOUNT.md](FIDELITY_A_PLAIN_ACCOUNT.md) (no
   logic required) and the lived scenarios in
   [ARISBE_IN_PRACTICE.md](ARISBE_IN_PRACTICE.md).

**The two reflexes worth keeping for life** (both from the Field Guide). First,
*posited vs. derived*: did someone **assert** this premise, or did the **rules hand
it to you**? The picture won't tell you. Second, *a fragment is a building block*:
a lone graph usually comes as an **extract**; ask what whole it was cut from and
what universe it stands in.

**Your frontier:** none — this door has no prerequisites. The only trap lies in
rushing past the dragons; they catch experts too (and caught the author writing
the guide).

---

### 2b. The ontologist — "I have vocabularies, OWL/RDF, a T-box"

Arisbe treats an **ontology as a theory you can draw and reason in**. Every
terminological box ([T-box](GLOSSARY.md#t-box)) axiom already takes an EG shape:
subsumption draws as a *scroll*, disjointness as a denial, domain/range as typing
scrolls. You bring a file in; it becomes a `kind=ontology` Universe of Discourse
you can browse in Organon and play as a **model M** in Agon.

**Shortest path in:**
0. If you skipped §1's shared five minutes, take them first — install, open
   `/organon`, pick the corpus exemplar `peirce_cp_4_394_man_mortal` (it lives
   in the `tomos/` corpus), toggle its four linear forms (EGIF / CGIF / CLIF /
   FOPL), then draw one freehand in `/ergasterion` and let the reader grade it.
   Five minutes, and you have seen the round-trip your files will ride on.
1. Read [EXTERNAL_SOURCES_AND_IMPORT.md](EXTERNAL_SOURCES_AND_IMPORT.md), the
   consolidating import doc. It tells you what enters, at what [warrant](GLOSSARY.md#warrant), attributed
   how, attested how. It serves as your main door.
2. Bring a file: **Web Ontology Language ([OWL](GLOSSARY.md#owl))** (Functional-Style `.ofn`) and **Resource Description Framework ([RDF](GLOSSARY.md#rdf))** (Turtle/RDF-XML/…)
   travel **OWL → CLIF → Existential Graph Instance ([EGI](GLOSSARY.md#egi))**; **Standard Upper Ontology Knowledge Interchange Format ([SUO-KIF](GLOSSARY.md#suo-kif))** and raw **CLIF/Common Logic Ontology Repository ([COLORE](GLOSSARY.md#colore))** import directly
   (`clif_parser_dau` handles the back half). See the tool/module table in that doc.
3. Ask a question of it. In `/agon`, pick your imported ontology as M and let
   `theory_query.entails` decide a **subsumption / intersection / transitivity**
   theorem — the "is G a theorem of this theory?" [episode](GLOSSARY.md#episode). The conceptual account lives in
   [DOMAIN_ORACLE_AND_M.md](DOMAIN_ORACLE_AND_M.md) §6.2.

**What you most want to know, stated honestly:**
- **Honest partial translation.** When Arisbe can't express a construct as ground
  EG (cardinality, union, `AllValuesFrom`, datatypes, modal/higher-order SUO-KIF),
  it **reports the construct rather than silently dropping it.** Bring across the
  expressible ground, at low warrant, and be explicit about the rest. (The same
  [floor](GLOSSARY.md#floor) (the baseline that may not be gone under) holds here as everywhere
  else: *attest correspondence, not truth*.)
- **The upper ontology is Peircean.** SUMO's top division
  (`Independent / Relative / Mediating` under `Entity`) *is* Peirce's
  Firstness / Secondness / Thirdness. At the root of a modern merged ontology
  stands the triad the rest of the corpus rests on.
- **Frontier:** Manchester OWL syntax (no maintained Python parser — deferred); a
  **web import-doorway notation** for multi-axiom ontologies (would flatten the
  skip-report — not yet surfaced); and **layout performance** for very large
  theories (a 100+-axiom ontology imports correctly but takes super-linear time to
  *draw* — large taxonomies live as spines + translators today). All three live in
  [EXTERNAL_SOURCES_AND_IMPORT.md](EXTERNAL_SOURCES_AND_IMPORT.md) §6.

---

### 2c. The logician — "I want a sound calculus and round-tripped notations"

Arisbe implements **Dau's formalization** of Alpha (cut, sheet, juxtaposition) and
Beta (the line of identity) faithfully, with all **six transformation rules** (ERA,
INS, IT+, IT−, DC+, DC−), Beta-aware. A graph round-trips across **four linear
notations** and stays the same proposition everywhere.

**Shortest path in:**
1. [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) for the Peirce/Dau/Arisbe vocabulary, then
   [LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md](LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md), **the
   central contract**. Picture and proposition denote the *same* object — stated,
   tested, and runtime-attested (the correspondence check, §3.3).
2. Round-trip a form yourself: in any mode, toggle **EGIF / CGIF / CLIF / FOPL** on
   one graph. FOPL follows **Dau's Φ/Ψ translation** (Chapter 18), not a naïve
   conversion. [IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS.md](IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS.md) lists the
   formats and their modules.
3. Build a proof. The headless **RuleInteraction** protocol
   (`begin → advance → apply`) and the fluent **`ProofChain`** builder
   (`proof_authoring.py`, authoring by *locator* not ephemeral id) construct and
   replay derivations. The worked corpus proofs (Peirce's Law, Barbara, Leibniz's
   *Praeclarum Theorema*) stand as real chains you can step in Organon.

**What you most want to know:**
- **A step and its warrant make one act.** You cannot make a change and *then*
  check it. A rule won't apply unless its preconditions hold, so the move *is* its
  proof of soundness. ([CHAIN_OF_SEMIOSIS.md](CHAIN_OF_SEMIOSIS.md).)
- **Two games, not one.** The [Endoporeutic](GLOSSARY.md#endoporeutic) **contest** (Dau's six-rule proof game)
  and the inner **semantic** evaluation game ([peel](GLOSSARY.md#peel) (reading it from the outside in against the model) G against a model M → a
  three-valued Kleene verdict + witness/counterexample) stay distinct;
  deiteration bridges them. [GENERATION_AND_TESTING.md](GENERATION_AND_TESTING.md),
  [AUTOMATED_GRAPHEUS.md](AUTOMATED_GRAPHEUS.md).
- **Modality needs no new mark.** □/◇ go to ordinary Beta quantifiers over an
  accessibility relation, and the diachronic directed acyclic graph ([DAG](GLOSSARY.md#dag)) *is* that frame. *Gamma-as-modality
  stays out of scope* on purpose. [MODALITY_WITHOUT_GAMMA.md](MODALITY_WITHOUT_GAMMA.md).
- **Frontier:** the 3-LLM-role automated Endoporeutic Game (`src/agon_llm.py` —
  Graphist/Grapheus/Agonothetes under an incorruptible mechanical referee) and the
  tropism/attention-economy work steering directed engagement (`src/attention_economy.py`);
  see [DOMAIN_ORACLE_AND_M.md](DOMAIN_ORACLE_AND_M.md) for the shipped interpretation
  register (peel/materialize/theory-query). The universal-generalization rule's Dau-native
  scaffold now stands built (`src/derived_rules.py`, `universal_generalization`)
  ([UNIVERSAL_GENERALIZATION_DAU_HOMEWORK.md](UNIVERSAL_GENERALIZATION_DAU_HOMEWORK.md)).

**How to try to break it.** You can test the claims above from a clean checkout,
and a failing run counts as a finding the project wants. Three commands (all from
the repository root, after `python tools/bootstrap.py`; deployment contract added
2026-09-08):

1. **The mathematical core** — the Dau calculus, closure validation,
   isomorphism, and the Beta/propositional proof exercises (132 tests; a
   failure here means a real correctness defect, never noise):

   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_egi_core_comprehensive.py tests/test_chapter15_formal_calculus.py \
     tests/test_rule_interaction.py tests/test_subgraph_closure_validation.py \
     tests/test_graph_isomorphism_engine.py tests/test_beta_proof_exercises.py \
     tests/test_logical_proof_exercises.py tests/test_beta_converse_proof.py \
     tests/test_beta_modus_ponens_proof.py -q
   ```

2. **The conservativity gate** — the standing claim that the second-order
   opening (quotation/mention) leaves the Dau core untouched: corpus-wide
   invisibility, the erasure projection (a quoted law licenses nothing), and
   rules restraint ([SECOND_ORDER_CORE_OPENING.md](SECOND_ORDER_CORE_OPENING.md)):

   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_second_order_conservativity.py -q
   ```

3. **A worked chain, end to end** — the corpus proofs (Peirce's Law, Barbara,
   the *Praeclarum Theorema*, …) rebuilt as real rule applications against an
   isolated corpus, persisted, re-loaded, and re-attested:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_fixture_chains.py tests/test_chain_persistence.py -q
   ```

   (To *read* rather than re-run them, step the same chains move by move
   in Organon.)

If any of these passes vacuously, or you can construct a graph the rules
accept that Dau's calculus would refuse, you have found precisely the
refutation the project invites; see the standing invitation in
[CONTRIBUTION_AND_PRIOR_ART.md](CONTRIBUTION_AND_PRIOR_ART.md).

---

### 2d. The mathematician — "I want the formal object and the invariants"

The fundamental object is **not a diagram** but the **Universe of Discourse**, a
*diachronic* (evolving) reasoning process; a single EG gives a *synchronic*
snapshot. The data model stays **immutable**. State advances only by constructing
a new graph, so provenance grows append-only and history forms a branching **DAG**.

**Shortest path in:**
1. [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — the annotated module map, the data-model
   invariants, and the mathematical-foundation chapter mapping (code chapters track
   Dau's textbook: Ch. 14/15 rules, Ch. 16–17 ligatures/soundness, Ch. 18 Φ/Ψ,
   Ch. 20 syntactic equivalence).
2. The formal structure: **EGI** = `RelationalGraphWithCuts` `(V, E, ν, ⊤, Cut,
   area, ρ)` (`egi_core_dau.py`), carrying **two co-resident structures** over one
   element population — cut-containment (a tree) and ligatures (the W-partition,
   cutting across the hierarchy). [UNIVERSE_OF_DISCOURSE_ARCHITECTURE.md](UNIVERSE_OF_DISCOURSE_ARCHITECTURE.md),
   [DAG_HISTORY_ARCHITECTURE.md](DAG_HISTORY_ARCHITECTURE.md).
3. The **correspondence machinery** — your likely interest. Layout works as a
   *coordinate-free projection*: `natural_layout` (containment tree + per-ligature
   required **crossing-sequence** + incidence + ports) imports no geometry, so a
   future 3-D projection remains additive; renderers (Eclipse Layout Kernel ([ELK](GLOSSARY.md#elk)), the experimental *tension*
   engine) serve as pluggable optimizers within those constraints; `attest_correspondence`
   enforces §3.3 at runtime. [LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md](LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md)
   §3.1–3.3, [TENSION_LAYOUT.md](TENSION_LAYOUT.md).

**What you most want to know:**
- **The ligature-crossing invariant is topological, not metric.** A per-ligature
  crossing-sequence derives from the containment tree, and the check compares
  actual against required as a multiset (buffers fail; topology holds).
- **Three regimes scope the invariant**: composition (suspended), asserted
  (mandatory, attested), presentation-only (free, preserved by construction via
  `presentation_ops`, boundary crossings raise `Regime3Violation`).
- **The math core test suite must always pass.** A failing core test signals a real
  correctness defect, not noise. The genuine calculus core comprises 14 protected
  modules.
- **Frontier:** the named research direction remains **second-order logic about the
  graphs themselves** (graphs of graphs, abstraction, predication of qualities);
  a toe-in-water already exists (`schema.py`, the math-fixtures track). Not modality.
  [MODALITY_WITHOUT_GAMMA.md](MODALITY_WITHOUT_GAMMA.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) #13.

---

### 2e. The Peirce scholar — "I care about fidelity, history, and provenance"

Arisbe does not try to improve Peirce's calculus. It implements Dau's rigorous
formalization faithfully and stays honest about the **three places it consciously
departs**, each examined adversarially and surviving *with amendment*. The corpus
forms a **library of universes**, faithful to a community across history rather
than cured into one consistent whole.

**Shortest path in:**
1. [ARISBE_FOR_SCHOLARS.md](ARISBE_FOR_SCHOLARS.md) — the scholar's introduction
   (and the specific questions it puts to readers in the Pietarinen tradition: the
   *[Agonothetes](GLOSSARY.md#agonothetes)* (the role that turns the game's outcome into an act of inquiry) construct, and the correspondence invariant as **mechanized
   iconicity** — the claim that the graph *is* the proposition, not a notation for
   it).
2. The departures, plain then precise:
   [FIDELITY_A_PLAIN_ACCOUNT.md](FIDELITY_A_PLAIN_ACCOUNT.md) → then
   [FIDELITY_AND_DEPARTURES.md](FIDELITY_AND_DEPARTURES.md) +
   [ADVERSARIAL_EXAMINATION.md](ADVERSARIAL_EXAMINATION.md) (the doubts written as
   charges, attacked by hired prosecutors, kept only where they survived).
3. **Transcription with provenance.** Every corpus item carries a typed provenance
   bundle: its **import kind** (exemplar / proof / pattern / domain_model /
   ontology), *transcribed-vs-authored*, and *cited-vs-synthetic* — three different
   facts you must not collapse. A synthetic test graph may **never** carry a
   fabricated citation (enforced). [CORPUS_AND_IMPORT_MODEL.md](CORPUS_AND_IMPORT_MODEL.md),
   [ORGANON_IMPORT_WALKTHROUGH.md](archived/ORGANON_IMPORT_WALKTHROUGH.md).

**What you most want to know:**
- **No mark bears actuality.** A mark may carry *form* (negation, conditionality,
  even modality-as-form) but never *actuality* — no solid line for "fact," no
  dotted line for "the real world." Arisbe names polarity **in words, never by
  colour**. [MANIFEST_AND_MEANING.md](MANIFEST_AND_MEANING.md).
- **To assert is to take responsibility** (Peirce's 1906 Phemic Sheet). Assertion
  works as an *act*, not a feature of the drawing. Arisbe marks the [seam](GLOSSARY.md#seam) the
  everyday presentations leave flush: posited premise (low warrant) vs. derived
  theorem (end of a sound chain). [LEVEL_ZERO_AND_THE_REGISTERS.md](LEVEL_ZERO_AND_THE_REGISTERS.md).
- **For publication:** the authentic-Peirce **LaTeX/TikZ export** reimplements the
  *function* of Jukka Nikulainen's `egpeirce.sty` (oval cuts, scrolls, heavy lines
  of identity, hooks) in pure pdflatex — wedded to the §3.3-attested graph and
  delta-faithful (export what you *adjusted* to see). It ships as the `peirce-tikz`
  format and a worked-chain → multi-figure document. [FEATURE_PEIRCE_SCHOLARLY_REPRODUCTION.md](FEATURE_PEIRCE_SCHOLARLY_REPRODUCTION.md).
- **Frontier:** the by-hand **reading desk** (interactive transcription of a graph +
  provenance through the UI) remains wanted but not yet a single surface; the
  building blocks exist. [CORPUS_AND_IMPORT_MODEL.md](CORPUS_AND_IMPORT_MODEL.md) §6.

## 3. If you are about to change code

This doc serves *using* and *orienting*. If you are about to **contribute**, the
reading order changes: start with [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (module map,
commands, invariants, test inventory) and the contributor track in
[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md), and read
[LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md](LINEAR_GRAPHICAL_CORRESPONDENCE.md) before
touching anything that produces or consumes an `(EGI, drawing)` pair. For the
capability/test home of everything, see [CAPABILITY_MAP.md](CAPABILITY_MAP.md).
